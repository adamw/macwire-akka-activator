    <title>No-framework Dependency Injection with MacWire and Akka Activator</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>
    <p>You've just created the MacWire + Akka example application! Let's explore what's inside.</p>

    <h2>Application overview</h2>

    <p>
        The functionality of this console application is to calculate a lucky number basing on the user's age and
        favorite color.
    </p>

    <p>
        The task is quite simple and the code is definitely too complicated for such a simple functionality, but it
        should serve demo purposes well.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are two main parts: the <code>calculator</code> module and the <code>actors</code> module. We'll explore 
        each module in detail in the following sections, focusing on <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>, using 
        <code>trait</code>s as modules, MacWire and integration with Akka.
    </p>

    <p>
        To see how the application works, just <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> it! There's no fancy UI, unless
        you consider the console to be fancy :).
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's start exploring the <a href="#code">code</a> (open the sidebar to read the tutorial along with the code)!
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The calculator package</h2>

    <p>
        The main class in the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/calculator" class="shortcut">calculator</a> package is the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/calculator/CalculateLuckyNumber.scala" class="shortcut">CalculateLuckyNumber</a>
        class. It implements the main logic of actually computing the lucky number.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the <code>CalculateLuckyNumber</code> has two dependencies:
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/calculator/InterpretFavoriteColor.scala" class="shortcut">InterpretFavoriteColor</a>
        and <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/calculator/RandomModifier.scala" class="shortcut">RandomModifier</a>
        (as we all know, all lucky number computations are to some degree random). All of the classes are quite simple,
        and in the end we simply add up all the numbers we get.
    </p>

    <h3>Dependency Injection</h3>

    <p>
        The fact that <code>CalculateLuckyNumber</code> is dependent on <code>InterpretFavoriteColor</code> and
        <code>RandomModifier</code> is expressed using a constructor parameter. And this is the main idea behind
        <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>: instead of creating a specific implementation of e.g. an
        <code>InterpretFavoriteColor</code> inside the <code>CalculateLuckyNumber</code> class using
        <code>new</code>, we only specify that we want "some" implementation. This decouples the two classes, as we
        can now use <strong>any</strong> <code>InterpretFavoriteColor</code> implementation, without the need to change
        the code of the <code>CalculateLuckyNumber</code> class.
    </p>

    <p>
        The removal of creational concerns from the code leads to less code pollution and increased testability. Very
        often usage of Dependency Injection is accompanied by a framework, such as
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Guice</a> or <a href="http://spring.io/">Spring</a>.
        However, a framework is not required, and as this tutorial demonstrates, Scala language features can be used
        instead. Also, the mentioned frameworks most often rely on run-time reflection and hence provide less type
        safety. That said, they offer some advanced features which are not possible to achieve only with Scala/
        <a href="https://github.com/adamw/macwire">MacWire</a>.
        For a more detailed comparison, please refer to the materials mentioned at the end of the tutorial.
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>The calculator module</h2>

    <p>
        The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/calculator" class="shortcut">calculator</a> package also contains a
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/calculator/CalculatorModule.scala" class="shortcut">CalculatorModule</a> trait.
        In the trait we define how to create instances of the objects from this package.
    </p>

    <p>
        In many cases we can just call <code>new</code> with the right parameters to create the object graph. Note that
        even when calling <code>new</code> directly, we are doing Dependency Injection! The main point is that creating
        the objects (object graph) is done separately from defining the classes. Here however, we are using MacWire
        to remove a bit of the boilerplate that is associated with creating the instances.
    </p>

    <h3>MacWire</h3>

    <p>
        The instances are defined using the <code>wire</code> macro. A macro is a piece of Scala code which is
        executed at <strong>compile time</strong>, generating Scala code. The code is then type-checked and further
        compiled using standard rules. The <code>wire</code> macro is part of the MacWire library.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>wire</code> macro will try to generate code to create a new instance of the given class, using as
        parameters values found in the current scope. For example,
        <pre><code>wire[CalculateLuckyNumber]</code></pre>
        will expand to
        <pre><code>new CalculateLuckyNumber(randomModifier,
            interpretFavoriteColor)</code></pre>
        Note that this is all done at compile-time - there's no run-time component here! At run-time, all the JVM
        will see is <code>new</code> invocation. And we get compile-time checking that all dependencies of a class
        are satisfied!
    </p>

    <p>
        Wiring using the macro can be useful when classes have several dependencies and enumerating all construction
        parameters would be tedious. Moreover the macro can be used only for some objects, others may be created by
        hand or using more complex custom code.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The calculator module #2</h2>

    <h3>Why lazy?</h3>

    <p>
        We use <code>lazy val</code>s, so that we don't have to worry about initialization order. When using
        <code>val</code>s objects have to be defined prior to usage. This can lead to weird
        <code>NullPointerException</code>s, hence if possible just use <code>lazy val</code>s or <code>def</code>s.
    </p>

    <h3>Trait-modules are optional</h3>

    <p>
        In smaller applications we could define the <strong>wiring</strong> (how the object graph is constructed) in one
        trait/object for all packages, however as the codebase size grows, it can become hard to manage, hence splitting
        into several "modules" may be a good idea. The <strong>cake pattern</strong> takes this idea even further,
        putting also class definitions into the traits.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that creating such traits is entirely optional and is not a part of the "core" <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>
        pattern. It is simply a way of using Scala's traits to make the code more manageable, and the pattern easier
        to use.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The actors package</h2>

    <p>
        The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/actors" class="shortcut">actors</a> package contains three actors
        which are responsible for accepting user requests, calculating the lucky number and emailing it back to the
        user (well, email support will be available in 2.0, here we are just printing to the console).
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/actors/CalculateRequest.scala" class="shortcut">CalculateRequest</a> is
        a simple data container which represents a user request. It is used by the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/actors/CalculateActor.scala" class="shortcut">CalculateActor</a> to
        compute the lucky number and send it back to the sender. Note that the actor has a dependency - the service
        we defined earlier in the <code>calculator</code> package.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/actors/EmailActor.scala" class="shortcut">EmailActor</a> just prints
        outs any strings it get to the console. A much more interesting actor is the main one,
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/actors/EmailLuckyNumbersActor.scala" class="shortcut">EmailLuckyNumbersActor</a>.
        That actor accepts requests, sends them to be calculated, and upon receiving a reply, emails the result.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's a number of good ways to compose actors and pass around actor references; one quite widely used is
        sending the <code>ActorRef</code>s of collaborating actors in messages. Here, we are using another approach:
        passing the <code>ActorRef</code> as constructor parameters (dependencies). Both styles can be mixed of course,
        depending on the specific use-case.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Tagging</h2>

    <p>
        If you take a closer look at
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/actors/EmailLuckyNumbersActor.scala" class="shortcut">EmailLuckyNumbersActor</a>,
        you'll notice that the dependencies have "tags", <code>ActorRef @@ Calculate</code> and
        <code>ActorRef @@ Email</code>. The <code>@@ T</code> part comes from MacWire, and is entirerly optional, but it
        helps to differentiate which actor reference is which and gives some additional compile-time type checks; we
        can only use properly tagged instances when passing parameters around.
    </p>

    <p>
        The tags have no runtime overhead and the original idea comes from
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/milessabin/89c9b47a91017973a35f">Miles Sabin</a> and is also
        used e.g. in <a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz">Scalaz</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tags can be added to an instance using the <code>.taggedWith[T]</code> method, which is available after importing
        <code>com.softwaremill.macwire._</code>. For example, we could tag an existing actor reference like this:
        <pre><code>someActorRef.taggedWith[Email]</code></pre>
        The tags are usually simple <code>trait</code>s.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The actors module</h2>

    <p>
        Just as with the <code>calculator</code> module, there's also a trait-module for <acode>actors</acode>, the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/actors/ActorsModule.scala" class="shortcut">ActorsModule</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To create actors, first of all we need to have access to a <code>ActorSystem</code>. The module has an abstract
        value of that type, which expresses a dependency of the module (which is a "level higher" than a dependency of
        a single class). It also has another dependency, on a <code>CalculateLuckyNumber</code>. Any usages of that
        module will have to provide an implementation of these two values, and this will be enforced by the compiler.
    </p>

    <p>
        Secondly, creating actors is a bit different then creating normal objects, as we have to wrap the actor-instance
        creation code with <code>actorSystem.actorOf(Props(...))</code>. As actors should be created with care, and we
        probably only want them to be created explicitly, we are using <code>def create...()</code> methods, instead of
        values.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that we are tagging the email/calculate actors appropriately, and that creating the <code>EmailLuckyNumbersActor</code>
        requires references to other actors being passed in. These actor references from method parameters will be
        used when creating a <code>EmailLuckyNumbersActor</code> instance.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Main class</h2>

    <p>
        The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/activator/LuckyNumberDemo.scala" class="shortcut">LuckyNumberDemo</a> main class
        wraps all that we have done so far together.
    </p>

    <p>
        First of all, we extend both modules we have defined: <code>CalculatorModule</code> and
        <code>ActorsModule</code>. This brings into scope all of the values and methods defined. Note that also
        the <code>EmailLuckyNumbersActor</code> dependency from <code>ActorsModule</code> is automatically satisfied
        by the definition in <code>CalculatorModule</code>
        (and of course, all of that is checked during compilation, using standard Scala mechanisms)!
        The actor system dependency is not defined in any module hence we have to define it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Secondly, we create the actors explicitly, passing around the right parameters. Thanks to tagging, we won't
        be able to mix the email and calculator actor references when passing them to
        <code>createEmailLuckyNumbersActor</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, we calculate the result for some example data using our actor infrastructure!
    </p>

    <p>
        Try yourself - just <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> the code and enjoy dependency injection with plain
        Scala, Akka and MacWire!
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Testing</h2>

    <p>
        A very important aspect of our application is testing. One of the main benefits of <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>
        is the ease with which you can test components in isolation, passing in alternative implementations of any
        of the class dependencies.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an example, take a look at
        <a href="#code/src/test/scala/activator/calculator/CalculateLuckyNumberTest.scala" class="shortcut">CalculateLuckyNumberTest</a>.
        To be able to verify the behavior of the calculator, we need to substitute the random modifier which something
        that isn't random, e.g. returns a constant number.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nothing easier! We just override the value from the module, and it will be used when wiring an instance of
        <code>CalculateLuckyNumber</code>!
    </p>

    <p>
        What we have created is in fact an integration test of the whole module. We could have also created a new
        <code>CalculateLuckyNumber</code> instance directly and pass in either real or mock dependencies.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The End</h2>

    <p>
        And that's it! We now have a simple Akka application, which uses <strong>Dependency Injection</strong> for
        wiring the services and actors.
    </p>

    <p>
        The whole integration layer doesn't use reflection, only type-safe, compile-time code generation. And we're only
        using plain, old Scala traits and classes, without the help of any framework.
